# How to contribute to Yar
Feature ideas, bug fixes and general refactoring of code is welcome!

## Did you stumble upon a bug?
+ Ensure the bug has not already been reported by searching the [issues](https://github.com/nielsing/yar/issues) tab.
+ If there is no issue addressing the problem then please open a new one. When submitting an issue for a bug be sure to include 
a title that explains what it is in short, i.e. "Yar crashes when I do X" or "I was scanning repo X and yar crashed" or "There is a one by off error in X". Also make sure to
include a clear description. A clear description includes a stack trace (if Yar crashed) and the command you were running.
+ If you've already looked into the code (big props to you!) and found a possible fix then please suggest your fix for the bug
as well in the description.

## Wrote a fix for the bug?
+ Open a new Github pull request with the fix.
+ The PR description must clearly describe the problem and the solution. Also please include the relevant issue number if possible.

## Want a new feature implemented for Yar?
+ Check if it hasn't already been requested.
+ Open an issue labeled as a feature request. 
+ The issue should contain a description of the feature and why you think this will be a good addition to Yar.

## Added a new feature for Yar?
+ Please only do this if an issue for the feature request has been posted before hand and it got the A-ok.
+ Fork the repo, do some coding and open a pull request.
+ The pull request should have a short and concise description.

## In short
+ Search for existing issues for your bug/feature.
+ If there is no issue regarding your specific bug/feature, then open an issue to discuss it.
+ Once you have the A-ok, fork the repo, code away and open a pull request.
+ Make sure the code atleast builds before opening the pull request though.
